<b style="font-size:25px;">Lifi</b></style><br>
Light Fidelity or is a Visible Light Communications (VLC)
system running wireless communications travelling at very
high speeds. Li-Fi uses common household LED (light
emitting diodes) light bulbs to enable data transfer, boasting
speeds of up to 224 gigabits per second. The term Li-Fi was
coined by University of Edinburgh Professor Harald Haas
during a TED Talk in 2011. Haas envisioned light bulbs that
could act as wireless routers. Subsequently, in 2012 after
four years of research, Haas set up company pure Li-Fi with
the aim 'to be the world leader in Visible Light
Communications technology'.<br>

As we now know, Li-Fi is a Visible
Light Communications (VLC) system. This means that it
accommodates a photo-detector to receive light signals and a
signal processing element to convert the data into 'streamable' content. An LED lightbulb is a semi-conductor light
source meaning that the constant current of electricity
supplied to an LED lightbulb can be dipped and dimmed, up
and down at extremely high speeds, without being visible to
the human eye. For example, data is fed into an LED light
bulb (with signal processing technology), it then sends data
(embedded in its beam) at rapid speeds to the photodetector (photodiode). The tiny changes in the rapid
dimming of LED bulbs is then converted by the 'receiver' into
electrical signal. The signal is then converted back into a
binary data stream that we would recognise as web, video
and audio applications that run on internet enables devices.<br>

<b style="font-size:25px;font-family:cursive;">Wifi</style></b><br>
<p style="font-family:cursive;font-size:20px;">
Wi-Fi stands for Wireless Fidelity. It is based on the
IEEE 802.11 family of standards and is primarily a local area
networking (LAN) technology designed to provide inbuilding broadband coverage. Current Wi-Fi systems
support a peak physical-layer data rate of 54 Mbps and
typically provide indoor coverage over a distance of 100 feet.
Wi-Fi has become the de facto standard for last mile
broadband connectivity in homes, offices, and public hotspot
locations. Systems can typically provide a coverage range of
only about 1,000 feet from the access point. Wi-Fi offers
remarkably higher peak data rates than do 3G systems,
primarily since it operates over a larger 20 MHz bandwidth,
but Wi-Fi systems are not designed to support highspeed mobility. <br>

<b style="font-size:25px;font-family: cursive;">Working of Wifi</style></b><br>
<p style="font-family:cursive;font-size:20px;">
Radio Signals are the keys, which make Wi-Fi networking
possible. These radio signals transmitted from Wi-Fi
antennas are picked up by Wi-Fi receivers, such as
computers and cell phones that are equipped with Wi-Fi
cards. Whenever, a computer receives any of the signals
within the range of a Wi-Fi network, which is usually 300
500 feet for antennas, the Wi-Fi card reads the signals and
thus creates an internet connection between the user and
the network without the use of a card. Access points,
consisting of antennas and routers, are the main source that
transmit and receive radio waves.A Wi-Fi hotspot is created by installing an access point to an
internet connection. The access point transmits a wireless
signal over a short distance. It typically covers around 300
feet. When a Wi-Fi enabled device such as a Pocket PC
encounters a hotspot, the device can then connect to that
network wirelessly. Most hotspots are located in places that
are readily accessible to the public such as airports, coffee
shops, hotels, book stores, and campus environments.<br>

<b style="font-family:cursive;font-size:25px;">The main differences between lifi and wifi are:</b></style><br></style>
<ol style="font-family:cursive;font-size:20px;">
<li>While some may think that Li-Fi with its 224
    gigabits per second leaves Wi-Fi in the dust, Li-Fi's
    exclusive use of visible light could halt a mass
    uptake.</li>
<li>Li-Fi signals cannot pass through walls, so in order
    to enjoy full connectivity, capable LED bulbs will
    need to be placed throughout the home. Li-Fi
    requires the lightbulb is on at all times to provide
    connectivity, meaning that the lights will need to be
    on during the day.</li>
<li>Li-Fi is more secure than Wi-Fi and it's reported
    that embedded light beams reflected off a surface
    could still achieve 70 megabits per second.</li>
<li>Li-Fi could make a huge impact on the internet of
    things too, with data transferred at much higher
    levels with even more devices able to connect to
    one another.</li>

<b><u style="font-size:25px;font-family: cursive;">CONCLUSION:</style></u></b><br>
<p style="font-family:cursive;font-size:20px;">
The wireless communication already contributed a huge
revolution in the telecom sectors from the last three decades.
Wi-Fi gives us the point-to-multiple point internet facility, by
which we can create the Wi-Fi hotspot zone anywhere. As
per the demand of consumers we introduced the Li-Fi
technology for more than 1 Gbps speed.</p>
